0. Vocabulary
Pascal casing: This convention capitalizes the first character of each word. No underscore is used between words.
Examples: EventType, BoolExpr, MethodCall.

Camel casing: The first character of each word except for the first one is capitalized. No underscore is used between words.
Examples: annProgram, annMethod.
NOTE: Camel casing in will not be used in this specification.

PVS casing: words are in lower case and are separated by underscores.
Examples: ann_program, ann_method


1. Names
1.1 Theories
Theories are written in Pascal casing. There should be no underscores.
E.g. MVASemantics, MVACompletion, MonitoredProgramSemantics.

1.2 Datatypes
Datatypes, constructors and destructors should be in Pascal casing.
E.g. BoolExpr, BoolVarEval, VarEval?.

1.3 Records
Record names use Pascal casing but its component use PVS casing. Example
  MVAVarDecl : TYPE =
    [# name : Name,
       jtype : JType,
       init_val : Expr[Name]
    #]

1.4 Variables, functions, lemmas, etc
They use PVS casing. 
Examples: complete_MVA, lookup_field, ann_program.

NOTE: When on of the words involved is a datatype or a record it is written as its definition. Examples: complete_MVA, valid_PSt.

NOTE: Sometimes a letter is used differentiate two similar names. This may be a capital letter as in vdsA and vdsP

1.5 Keywords
PVS keywords are written in capitals. E.g. AND, FORALL, LAMBDA


2. Spaces
2.1 Colons
Leave a space before and after a colon. Examples
FORALL (v : Var) :
some_name : LEMMA

2.2 Keywords
Leave a space between a keyword and a parenthesis. Applicable to FORALL, EXISTS and LAMBDA. Example:
LAMBDA (x : X) : (not LAMBDA(x : X))


3. Indentation
Use an indentation of 2 spaces
Try not to exceed the column 80
