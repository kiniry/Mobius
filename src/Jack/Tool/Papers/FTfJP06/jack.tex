\section{Introduction}
The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a widely used specification language 
used to annotate Java programs for both runtime verification and static 
verification. It has a vast syntax defined in its manual and most of the 
tools only implement a part of its syntax. The part of JML we will be 
interested to in this paper is one that is common in most of the tools 
using JML \cite{BurdyEtAl05:STTT}: pure methods, ghost variables and  
model fields. 

When doing program verification with JML, one of the difficulties that appears
is to handle the connection between the specifications and the interpreted 
program specifications.We have decided to add the keyword \code{native}
to specify some specification-only methods and types that would be 
directly defined to the environment to which specifications are interpreted. 
This keyword can be used in dynamic verification of programs, 
but it is in a static verification context, that it can be the most helpful.
It can be used to define predicates, as well as give a real definition 
to which lemmas can be proven upon.

In order to test our new construct and our modifications of the JML language 
we have used a tool that does static program verification,  Jack 
(the Java Applet Correctness Kit)\cite{BRL-03-JACK,Jack-Web}. 
Jack takes as an entry Java programs annotated with JML. 
The proof obligations are generated to an intermediate language called JPOL 
(the Java Proof Obligation Language) and afterward are translated into 
proof languages, like Coq, Simplify, AtelierB and PVS. 
Jack handles most of JML constructs, and is integrated as a plugin within 
Eclipse \cite{Eclipse-Web}.
%and has already a custom JML keyword:  \code{ loop\_modify} 
% which permits to specify which variables are modified within a loop.

The latest developments in Jack concern its Coq output. 
The interest of this output is that it permits to prove interactively some 
proof obligations that would not be provable automatically in a first order 
prover like Simplify \cite{simplify}.
Together with the Simplify output this is the output which is used the most.
Coq is a proof assistant based on the calculus of inductive construction 
\cite{coq}. 
It can express 
higher-order logic which first-order automatic provers cannot. In Jack's Coq 
output, the logic of Java is  expressed through Coq as axioms, definitions, 
inductive definitions as well as recursive 
functions (in more sparse cases).

In section 2,  we will discuss of the pure methods and their interpretation 
in Jack. We will then introduce
the \code{native} keyword and its use to define predicates.
% as well as to define special types in section 3. 
In section 3, we will define the \code{native} types and we will see the 
application of these constructs 
as a way to implement JML's model classes.
Finally, in section 4, we will show applications of the native libraries with 
 ghost variables and model fields.
