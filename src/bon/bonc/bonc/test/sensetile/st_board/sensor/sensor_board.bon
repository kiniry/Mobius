 \and controls the transfer of data from the Tx packet FIFO to the Tx \
 \(transmit) interface of the ASYNCI cluster."
    
cluster DEFRAMER
description
  "The DEFRAMER cluster firstly assembles bytes from the Rx interface \
  \of the ASYNCI interface into 16 bit characters, using latching \
  \signals from the bus controller module. These 16 bit characters are \
  \assembled in MS Byte first format. The packet decode logic then \
  \operates on this sequence of 16 bit characters, either decoding \
  \character values as commands or writing the characters directly \
  \to the CONVERTER cluster via a buffer or storing them in STORAGE cluster,\
  \depending on the state of the decode state machine and the bit fields in the charcter."

cluster ASYNCI
description
  "The ASYNCI cluster joins an internal GATE_ARRAY Tx  byte interface \
  \and an internal GATE_ARRAY Rx byte interface to the  USB_CHANNEL \
