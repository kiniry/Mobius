%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Visibility}
\vspace*{-4ex}

JML imposes visibility rules similar to Java, eg.

\begin{alltt}
\code{\scriptsize   public class Bag\{
     ...
     {\green private} int{\green n};

    //@ requires{\green n} > 0;
     {\blue public} int{\blue extractMin}()\{ ... \}
}
\end{alltt}  %}

is not type-correct, because
{\blue public} method {\blue \code{extractMin}}
refers to {\green private} field {\green\code{n}}.

\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Visibility}
\vspace*{-4ex}

\begin{alltt}
\code{\scriptsize {\blue public} int{\blue pub}; {\green private} int{\green priv}; 

 {\black //@} requires i <={\blue pub};
 {\blue public} void{\blue pub1} (int i) \{ ... \}

 {\black //@} requires i <={\blue pub} && i <={\green priv};
 {\green private} void{\green priv1} (int i) { ... } 

 {\black //@} requires i <={\blue pub} && i <={\green priv}; // WRONG !!
 {\blue public} void{\blue pub2}(int i) \{ ... \}
 }
\end{alltt}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Visibility: \texttt{spec\_public}}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Keyword \code{spec\_public} loosens visibility for specs.\\
Private \code{spec\_public} fields are allowed in public specs, e.g.:

\begin{alltt}
\code{\scriptsize   public class Bag\{
     ...
     {\green private}{\red /*@ spec\_public @*/} int{\green n};

      //@ requires{\green n} > 0;
     {\blue public} int{\blue extractMin}()\{ ... \}
}
\end{alltt} %}

\bigskip

{\scriptsize  Exposing private details can be ugly, of course.  A nicer, but more
  advanced alternative is to use public \code{model}
  fields to represent (abstract away from) private implementation
  details.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Exceptional specifications}
\vspace*{-4ex}

A method specification can (dis)allow the throwing of exceptions,
and specify a exceptional postcondition that should hold in
the event an exception is thrown.

\medskip

There are some implicit rules for (dis)allowing exceptions.

\medskip

Warning: exceptional specifications are 
easy to get wrong. 

\medskip

Not allowing any exceptions to be thrown is the simplest approach.

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Exceptions allowed by specs} 
\vspace*{-4ex}

By default, a method is allowed to throw exceptions, but only those listed
in its throws clause. So

\begin{alltt} \code{\scriptsize{\green //@}{\black requires} 0 <= amount && amount <= balance;
  public int{\green debit}(int amount)
                           throws BankException 
   \{ ... \}

}
\end{alltt}
has an implicit clause
\begin{alltt}
\code{\scriptsize{\blue signals} (BankException){\green true};}
\end{alltt}
and an implicit clause
\begin{alltt}
\code{\scriptsize{\blue signals} (Exception e){\green e instanceof BankException};}
\end{alltt}

\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Exceptions allowed by specs}
\vspace*{-4ex}

By default, a method is allowed to throw exceptions, \textit{but only those listed
in its throws clause.} So

\begin{alltt} \code{\scriptsize{\green //@}{\black requires} 0 <= amount && amount <= balance;
  public int{\green debit}(int amount) 
   \{ ... \}

}
\end{alltt}
has an implicit clause
\begin{alltt}
\code{\scriptsize{\blue signals} (Exception){\green false};}
\end{alltt}

NB \code{debit} is now not even allowed to throw an unchecked exception,
even though Java does not require a throws clause for these.

\end{slide}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Ruling out exceptions}
\vspace*{-4ex}

To forbid a particular exception \code{SomeException}
\begin{enumerate}
\item omit it from throws clause (only possible for unchecked exceptions)
\item add an explicit
\begin{alltt} \code{\scriptsize{\blue signals} (SomeException){\green false};}
\end{alltt}

\item limit the set of allowed exceptions, use a postcondition such as
\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize    signals (Exception e) e instanceof E1 
                       || ... 
                       || e instanceof En;}
\end{alltt}
or, equivalently, us the shorthand for this
\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize    signals_only E1, ... En;}
\end{alltt}

\end{enumerate}

\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Ruling out exceptions}
\vspace*{-4ex}

To forbid \textit{all} exceptions
\begin{enumerate}
\item omit all exceptions from throws clause (only possible for unchecked exceptions)
\item add an explicit
\begin{alltt} \code{\scriptsize{\blue signals} (Exception){\green false};}
\end{alltt}
\item
use keyword {\blue normal\_behavior} to rule out all exceptions
\begin{alltt} \code{\scriptsize {\green /*@}{\blue normal\_behavior}
       {\black requires} ...
       {\black ensures}  ...
    {\green @*/}
}
\end{alltt}
\mbox{\code{normal\_behavior} has implicit
\code{signals(Exception)false}}
\end{enumerate}

\end{slide}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{may vs must throw an exception}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Beware of the difference between 
\begin{quote}
{\green (1) if P holds, then \code{SomeException} is thrown}
\end{quote}
and
\begin{quote}
{\blue (2) if \code{SomeException} is thrown, then P holds}
\end{quote}

\medskip

These are easy to confuse!

\medskip

(2) can be expressed with {\blue \code{signals} }, \\
(1) can be expressed with {\green \code{exceptional\_behavior}}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{\texttt{exceptional\_behavior}}
\vspace*{-4ex}


\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize{\green /*@} exceptional_behavior
      requires amount > balance
      signals (BankException e) 
                e.getReason.equals("Amount too big")
{\green   @*/}
  public int{\green debit}(int amount) throws BankException 
 \{ ...  \}

}
\end{alltt}

says a \code{BankException} \textit{must} be thrown if \code{amount > balance}

\bigskip

\mbox{\code{{\green normal\_behavior}} has implicit
`\code{{\green signals(Exception)false}}}'

\smallskip
\code{\blue exceptional\_behavior} has implicit
`\code{{\blue ensures false}}'


\end{slide}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Example}
\vspace*{-4ex}

\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize{\green /*@} normal_behavior
        requires amount <= balance;
        ensures  ...
    also
      exceptional_behavior
        requires amount > balance
        signals (BankException e) ...
{\green   @*/}
  public int{\green debit}(int amount) throws BankException 
  \{ ...  \}
}
\end{alltt}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Example}
\vspace*{-4ex}

or, equivalently

\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize{\green /*@} requires true;
     ensures{\red \old(amount<=balance)} && ...
     signals (BankException e)  
            {\red \old(amount>balance)} && ...
{\green   @*/}
  public int{\green debit}(int amount) throws BankException 
  \{ ...  \}
}
\end{alltt}


\end{slide}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Exceptional behaviour}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Moral: to keep things simple, disallow exceptions
in specs whenever possible

\bigskip

{\footnotesize
Eg, for

\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public void{\green arraycopy}(int[] src, int destOffset, 
                       int[] dest, int destOffset, int length)
        throws NullPointerException,
               ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 

}
\end{alltt}

write a spec that disallows any throwing of exceptions, and only
worry about specifying exceptional behaviour if this is really needed
elsewhere.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Problems with assignable clauses}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Assignable clauses
\begin{itemize}
\item tend to expose implementation details
\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize  private /*@ spec_public @*/ int x;
  ...
  //@ assignable x, ....;
  public void m(...) \{....\} }
\end{alltt}
\item tend to become very long

\item tend to accumulate
\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize  //@ assignable x, f.x, g.y, h.z[*], ....;}

{\scriptsize \code{time} and \code{alarm} are {\red \code{model} fields}, ie.
specification-only fields}


\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Datagroups}
\vspace*{-4ex}


Datagroups provide an abstraction mechanism for assignable clauses.

\medskip

There's a default datagroup {\green \code{objectState}} defined in \code{Object.java}

\medskip

It's good practice to declare that all instance fields are
in \code{objectState}

\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Datagroups can be nested}
\vspace*{-4ex}

\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public class Timer\{

\vspace*{-4ex}

Another implementation, using an array of 6 digits to represent
hrs:mns:secs

\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public class ArrayTimer\{

  //@ invariant currentTime != null;
  //@ invariant currentTime.length == 6;

  //@ assignable currentTime[*];

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Datagroups and arrays}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Another implementation, using an array of 6 digits to represent
hrs:mns:secs

\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public class ArrayTimer\{
 {\red //@ public model JMLDatagroup time;}
  char[]{\green currentTime};{\red //@ in time;}
 {\red //@ maps currentTime[*] \into time;}

  //@ invariant currentTime.length == 6;

  //@ assignable{\red time};

  ...
\} }
\end{alltt} %}

\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Datagroups and interfaces}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Datagroups are convenient in specs for interfaces.


\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public interface TimerInterface\{
  //@ model{\red instance} public JMLDatagroup time, alarm;

  //@ assignable time;
  public void{\green tick}();
  //@ assignable alarm;
  public void{\green setAlarm}(int hrs, int mins, int secs);
\}

}
\end{alltt}

Classes implementing this interface are free to choose which fields
are in the datagroups.

{\scriptsize\rm Keyword \texttt{\textbf{instance}} is needed, because fields in interfaces
are by default static fields in Java.
Interfaces in Java do not have instance fields,
but in JML they can have \textit{model} instance fields
}


\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{The problem with assignable clauses}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Despite the abstraction possibilities offered by datagroups,
assignable clauses remain a bottlecneck both in program specification
and in program verification.

\medskip

{\scriptsize\rm Note that the proof obligation corresponding to an assignable
clause is a very complicated one, involving a quantification
over all fields not mentioned in the assignable clause}

\end{slide}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\part{{\Large \red Aliasing (revisited)}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Aliasing}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Aliasing is the root of all evil, for anyone trying to verify 
imperative programs.

\medskip

The \code{ArrayTimer} class just earlier is another nice example
to illustrate this.

\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{ArrayTimer example}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Recall implementation using an array of 6 digits to represent
hrs:mns:secs

\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public class ArrayTimer\{

  char[]{\green alarmTime};

  //@ invariant currentTime != null;
  //@ invariant currentTime.length == 6;
  //@ invariant alarmTime != null;
  //@ invariant alarmTime.length == 6;

  public void{\green tick}() \{ ... \}

  public void{\green setAlarm}(...) \{ ... \}
\}

}
\end{alltt}

\end{slide}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{ArrayTimer example}
\vspace*{-4ex}


Things will go wrong if different instances of \code{ArrayTimer}
share the same \code{alarmTime} array, ie.
\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize
  o.alarmTime == o'.alarmTime}

\end{alltt}
for some \code{o!=o'}

\medskip

ESC/Java2 may notice this, produce a correct, but puzzling, warning.


\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{ArrayTimer example}
\vspace*{-4ex}

To rule out such aliasing of eg. \code{alarmTime} fields:

\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public class ArrayTimer\{
  char[]{\green currentTime};
  //@ invariant currentTime.owner == this;
  ...

  public{\green ArrayTimer}( ...)\{
    ...;
    currentTime = new char[6];
    //@ set currentTime.owner == this;
    ...
  \} 
}
\end{alltt} %}

{\scriptsize\rm (\texttt{\textbf{owner}} is a so-called ghost field, more 
about that later)}

\end{slide}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{ArrayTimer example}

Things will go wrong if an instance of \code{ArrayTimer}
aliases its \code{alarmTime}  to its \code{currentTime}, ie.
\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize
  o.alarmTime == o.currentTime

ESC/Java2 may notice this, produce a correct, but puzzling warning.

\medskip

You should add
\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize
  //@ invariant alarmTime != currentTime;

to rule out such aliasing.

Suppose \code{Child extends Parent}.

\begin{itemize}
\item $\!$ {\green Behavioural subtyping} =
objects from subclass \code{Child} ``behave like'' 
objects from superclass \code{Parent}
\item $\!$ {\green Principle of substitutivity} [Liskov]:\\

\code{Child} object where a \code{Parent} object was expected. 
\end{itemize}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Behavioural subtyping}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Behavioural subtyping usually enforced by insisting that

\begin{itemize}
\item 
invariant in subclass is {\green stronger} than invariant in superclass
\item
for every method,
\begin{itemize}
\item 
precondition in subclass is {\blue weaker} (!) than precondition is superclass
\item 
postcondition in subclass is {\green stronger} than postcondition is superclass
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

JML achieves this using {\green specification inheritance}:
any child class {\green inherits} the specification of its parent.

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{$\!\!\!$\small Specification inheritance for invariants}

Invariants are inherited in subclasses. Eg.
\begin{alltt}

  class Child extends Parent \{
     ...

Method \code{m} in \code{Child} also has to meet the spec

\begin{alltt}
\code{\scriptsize class Child extends Parent \{

  /*@   requires i >= 0;

A {\blue\code{ghost}} field is like a normal field,

Maybe the object has some internal state that that records
if protocols is in progress, eg.

\begin{alltt}
\code{\scriptsize{class SimpleProtocol \{
 {\green //@ private ProtocolStack st;}
  ...
  public void start() \{ 
     ...
     st = new ProtocolStack(...);
     ...  \}
      
  public void stop() \{ 
     ... 
     st = null;
     ...  \}
 }}
\end{alltt} %}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Ghost fields - example}
\vspace*{-4ex}

There may be a relation between the {\blue ghost field} and some
{\green other field(s)}, eg.

\begin{alltt}
\code{\scriptsize{class SimpleProtocol \{
 {\green private ProtocolStack st;}
 {\blue //@ public ghost boolean started;}
  //@ invariant{\blue started} <==>{\green (st !=null)};

  //@ requires  !started;
  //@ assignable started;
  //@ ensures    started;
  public void start() \{ ...  \}
      
  //@ requires   started;
  //@ assignable started;
  //@ ensures   !started;
  public void stop() \{ ...  \} }}
\end{alltt} %}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Ghost fields - example}
\vspace*{-4ex}

We could now get rid of the ghost field, and write

\begin{alltt} \code{\scriptsize{class SimpleProtocol \{
 private /*@{\green spec\_public} @*/ ProtocolStack st;

  //@ requires  {\green st==null};
  //@ assignable st;
  //@ ensures  {\green  st!=null};
  public void start() \{ ... \}
      
  //@ requires  {\green st!=null};
  //@ assignable st;
  //@ ensures   {\green st==null};
  public void stop() \{ ... \} }}
\end{alltt} %}

but this is ugly and exposes implementation details.

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Model fields - example}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Solution: use a {\blue model} field

\begin{alltt} \code{\scriptsize class SimpleProtocol \{
  private ProtocolStack st;  

 {\blue //@ public \Red{model} boolean started;} 
 {\blue //@ private \Red{represents} started = (st != null);}

  //@ requires !started;
  //@ assigable started;
  //@ ensures   started;
  public void start() \{ ... \}
      
  //@ requires  started;
  //@ assigable started;
  //@ ensures  !started;
  public void stop() \{ ... \} }
\end{alltt} %}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Model fields - example}
\vspace*{-4ex}

A model field also provided an associated {\blue datagroup}

\begin{alltt} \code{\scriptsize class SimpleProtocol \{
  private ProtocolStack st;  {\red //@ in started;}

 {\blue //@ public \Red{model} boolean started;} 
 {\blue //@ private \Red{represents} started = (st != null);}

  //@ requires !started;
  //@ assigable started;
  //@ ensures   started;
  public void start() \{ ... \}
      
  //@ requires  started;
  //@ assigable started;
  //@ ensures  !started;
  public void stop() \{ ... \} }
\end{alltt} %}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Model vs ghost fields}
\vspace*{-4ex}


Difference between {\green ghost} and {\blue model} may be confusing!

Both exist only in JML specification, and not in the code.

\begin{itemize}
\item$\!$ {\green Ghost}\\
$\bullet$ Ghost field is like a normal field. \\
$\bullet$ You can assign to it, using \code{set}, in JML annotations.
\item$\!$ {\blue Model}\\
$\bullet$ Model field is an abstract field.\\
$\bullet$ Model field is a convenient abbreviation.\\
$\bullet$ You cannot assign to it.\\
$\bullet$ Model field changes
its value whenever the representation changes.
\end{itemize}

{\scriptsize Model field is like `abstract value' for ADT (algebraic data type),
represent clause is like `representation function'.}

\part{{\Large \red Invariants}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Invariants}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Invariants -- aka class invariants -- are a common \& very useful notion.

\medskip

In larger programs, the (only) interesting thing to specify are the invariants.

\medskip

However, the semantics is trickier than expected!

\medskip

Invariant is implicitly included in pre- and postconditions
of method, and in postcondition of constructors.
But there's more ...

\medskip

In fact, invariants are a hot research topic.

\end{slide}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{When should an invariant hold?}
\vspace*{-4ex}


\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public class A \{
   B b;
   int i=2; //@ invariant i >= 0
   
   //@ ensures \result >=0;
   public /*@ pure @*/ int get()\{ return i; \}
    
   public void m()\{
     i--;
     ... ; // invariant possibly broken
     i++;
   \}}
\end{alltt} %}

An invariant can temporarily be broken.

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{When should an invariant hold?}
\vspace*{-4ex}

\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public class A \{
   B b;
   int i=2; //@ invariant i >= 0

   //@ ensures \result >=0;
   public /*@ pure @*/ int get()\{ return i; \}
    
   public void m()\{
     i--;
    {\red b.m(...)}; // invariant possibly broken
     i++;
   \}}
\end{alltt} %}

This may lead to problems if invocation of \code{b.m}
involves an invoking on the current object.

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{When should an invariant hold?}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Eg, suppose

\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public class B \{
 ...
   public void m(A a)\{ 
    ... 
    int j = a.get(); //@ assert i>=0;
    ...
   \}}
\end{alltt} %}

The spec of \code{get()} suggests the assertion will be true.

\medskip

But if \code{get()} is invoked when \code{a}'s invariant is broken, all bets are off.

\medskip

This is known as the {\red call-back} problem.

\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{When should an invariant hold?}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Solution to the call-back problem:
\begin{quote}
A method invariant should hold in all so-called {\blue visible states},
which are all beginning and end states of method invocations
\end{quote}


So there's more to invariants than just adding them to pre- and postconditons.

\medskip

NB \textit{all} invariants of \textit{all} objects should hold in
visible states;
this clearly imposes impossible proof obligations.

\medskip

ESC/Java2 looks only at the invariants of some objects;
this is a source of unsoundness.

\medskip

Modular verification techniques for invariants are a challenge, and still 
a hot topic of research.

\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{When should an invariant hold?}
\vspace*{-4ex}

Sometimes you do want to invoke a method at a program point
where the invariant is broken.
To do this without ESC/Java2 complaining:

\vspace*{-4ex}

Sometimes you do want to invoke a method at a program point
where the invariant is broken.
To do this without ESC/Java2 complaining:

\begin{itemize}
\item
A private method can be declared as \code{helper} method
\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize private{\red /*@ helper @*/} void m() \{ ... \}}
\end{alltt}
Invariants do not have to hold when such a helper method is called.

\medskip

Effectively, such methods are in-lined in verifications

\end{itemize}

\vspace*{-4ex}


\begin{alltt}\code{\scriptsize public class SortedLinkedList \{
   private int{\green i};
   private LinkedList{\green next};
   //@ invariant i > next.i;
   public /*@ pure @*/ int{\green getValue}()\{ return i; \}
   public /*@ pure @*/ int{\green getNext}()\{ return next; \}
   public /*@ pure @*/ int{\green getValue}()\{ return i; \}
   public void{\green inc}() \{ i++; \}
  \}}
\end{alltt}

\code{inc} won't break this object's invariant, but may break the invariant
of the object who has this object as it's \code{next}.

\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{More problems with invariants}
\vspace*{-4ex}

The essence of the problem is that the invariant of
one object \code{o} may depend on the state of another object \code{o'}.

\medskip

When verifying the methods of \code{o'}, we have no way of knowing 
if these may break invariants given in other classes \ldots

\medskip

This is one of the sources of unsoundness of ESC/Java(2),
and most approaches to modular verification of OO programs to date.

\medskip

Only recently workable approaches for modular verification of invariants 
have been proposed, and the last word has not been said on this.
