  Extended Static Checking for Java - V2 - GUI application
</h1>

The ESC/Java2 tool is an updated version of 
<A HREF="http://research.compaq.com/SRC/esc/">ESC/Java</A>.
It is consistent with Java 1.4 and with the current version of
<A href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~leavens/JML/">JML</A>.
It is available as a 
<A href="http://www.niii.kun.nl/ita/sos/projects/escframe.html">Java release</A>
and there is additional information about how to use Esc/Java2 and JML
in that release.

The documentation page that you are now reading describes a GUI tool
that contains ESC/Java2, providing a convenient graphical interface
as an alternative to the command-line application.  Though you can try
this tool as it is, full use of it will require familiarity with 
static checking using Esc/Java2 and its parent, Esc/Java.

<A NAME="Start">
<h2>Starting the tool</h2>

The Esc/Java2 GUI tool is shipped as a double-clickable jar file
named esctools2.jar.  Thus
it can be launched either
<UL>
<LI> (a) by double-clicking the file (on most platforms), or
<LI> (b) by issuing the command-line command "java -jar esctools2.jar" or
<LI> (c) by issuing the command-line command "java -classpath esctools2.jar escjava.gui.GUI", or
<LI> (d) if you are working from a Esc/Java2 development environment or release, with the
command "escjava -gui" .  
</UL>
With options (b), (c) and (d), additional command-line arguments may be
appended as well.
<P>
Typechecking can be performed with this tool alone, but any static checking
requires in addition a copy of the Simplify executable appropriate for the platform.
There are versions of Simplify available in the Esc/Java2 release for Mac OS X, Windows, 
Linux, and Solaris platforms.
</p>

<A NAME="Organization">
<h2>Organization of the UI</h2>

The UI has the following pieces:
<UL>
<LI> a menubar across the top of the window or the top of the screen;
<LI> a number of buttons that provide easy access to some of the menubar functionality;
<LI> a status area;
<LI> a main panel with 4 tabs:
<UL>
<LI> a tab, "GUI Options", that allows the setting of options that
control the GUI tool itself (these are not saved as part of a project);
<LI> a tab, "ESC Options", that allows the setting of options that
control the running of the ESC/Java2 tool;
<LI> a tab, "Project files", in which classpaths and input files are listed;
<LI> a tab, "Results", that allows initiating and reviewing the results
of the static checking operations.
</UL>
<LI> The results panel itself has these elements:
<UL>
<LI> a panel showing a tree structure of the compilation units, 
types and routines contained in the input files;
<LI> a free-floating error message window (not initially shown);
<LI> a free-floating rudimentary source code display and editor window (not initially shown).
</UL>
<LI> Most GUI elements also have tooltips that provide 
information about the purpose of that element.
<LI> The "Help" menu has a menu item brings up this help document.
</UL>

<A NAME="Projects">
<h2>Projects</h2>

The tool allows work to be organized into 
<I>projects</I>.  A project contains the options, classpath definitions,
and list of the files, directories, packages, classes, or list files
 to be acted upon.  It is the same material as
would be specified on the command-line.  Project information can be
saved into project files and reloaded from project files.  Project 
files do not contain the results of the tool, only the input material.
The tool operates only on a single project at a time.
<p>
The tool begins with a default project.  All options are set to default
values, the classpath is obtained from the environment, and the list of
input files is empty.  Thus to begin work, you first have to add some
content to the project.  You do this on the "Project Files" tab.
<P>
Projects can be saved in and loaded from project files.  You can also use project
files from the command-line using the -f option.
<p>
<A NAME="GettingStarted">
<h2>Quick start</h2>
<p>
Step 1: Launch the tool by double-clicking the jar file, or by issuing the 
command "java -jar esctools2.jar" from the command-line.
<p>
Step 2: Click on the tab for the "ESC Options".  Enter into the text field
labeled "Path to Simplify executable" the absolute path of the executable 
appropriate for this platform.  You may use the "Browse" button to find the
executable using a graphical directory navigator, if you like.
<p>
Step 3: Click on the tab for "Project files".  Type into the text area, on a single
line, the path to a file containing the code to be checked.  If you need to adjust the 
CLASSPATH do so as well.  Multiple files may be listed, one per line.  You may
also give the path to a directory or the fully-qualified name of a package
or class.
<p>
Step 4: Click on the tab for "Result".  The name of the input file should be present
in the Results Pane.  Click the "Check" button.  The results tree will expand to show
the types and routine names found in the input file.  The will be colored green if the
various checks pass successfully.  If not, the nodes will be colored red and a text
window will appear containing error messages.
<p>
Step 5: To analyze the results, hold down the ALT key and
click on any node in the tree that is colored red.  
This will bring up a scrollable text window containing the messages generated by 
checking that item.  If a line in that window contains a filename and a line number,
you can click on the line to bring up an editor window for that file with the
offending line selected and viewable in the scrollable editor window.  Changes made
there can be saved back to the file by pressing the Save button.
[ In order for the changes to have an effect on the checking, you must reload
the input files by pressing the Reload button. ]
	   
<p>
  <a name="Details">
<h2>Details of a project</h2>

<B>Input files</B>: The tool operates on a set of input files, directories,
packages, classes or filelists.  These are listed one per line within the 
input file text area. 
<p>
Files and directories are listed by name in the
manner defined for the platform on which the tool is running; they are
found relative to the working directory of the shell in which the application
was launched.
Listing a directory is equivalent to
listing all the files in that directory that have active JML suffixes
(.java, .jml, .spec, .refines-java, .refines-spec, .refines-jml).
<p>
If a package name is listed it is looked for on the sourcepath
(rather than the working directory), and
results in the tool operating on all JML files in that package.
Similary, a fully-qualified class name is found on the sourcepath.
<p>
A filelist is a text file that contains the names of files, directories,
packages or other filelists, listed one per line.
<p>
White space before and after directory names is ignored; file and directory
names may be enclosed in quotes if they have internal white space.
<P>
The application interprets a given name as a file, directory, list, package
or class as best it can.  The user may help to disambiguate these by prefixing
the name on the same line with one of <code>-file</code>, <code>-dir</code>,
<code>-package</code>, <code>-class</code>, or <code>-list</code>.

<!--
<p>
<!-- <B>Browse button</B>: TBD??? 

<p>
<B>Working directory text field</B>:  The working directory is the directory 
relative to which files and directories specified on the command-line
are found.  The user can adjust the working directory for a project using
this text field.  The default value for the working directory depends
on the means by which the GUI tool is launched.  Using methods (a) or
(b) <A href="#Starting">above</A> the default is the user's home directory.
Using method (c), the default is the working directory of the shell
in which the command is issued. [TBD - CHeck this ???]
-->
<!--
<p>
<B>Sourcepath</B>:  The sourcepath is used to find the packages listed 
as input files and the specification files for any classes referenced
by the input files.  If the sourcepath is empty (the default), then its value is
the same as the classpath.  The sourcepath is not often used, but on
occasion is useful to provide different paths to find .class files
vs. .java and specification files.
-->
<p>
<B>Classpath text field</B>: The classpath is used to find any .class files for 
classes contained in or referenced by the input files (and for all .java
and specification files if there is no sourcepath).  By default, the
classpath value is taken from the environment (the CLASSPATH environment
variable).  If that is not defined the value will be just the working
directory.  The classpath (and sourcepath) is a sequence of directories
separated by a platform-dependent separator character (typically
either a colon or semi-colon); be sure to use the correct character for
your platform.

<p>
<B>Specpath text field</B>: The specpath is a directory path containing
specification files for system classes.  This would typically include
specifications for classes shipped with a Java implementation (e.g. for java.lang.String),
but might also include specifications for other class libraries you
use.  The jar file that contains the application also contains a set of 
specification files, so the default setting of the specpath is to the jar
file from which the application is launched.


<p>
  <a name="StaticChecking">
<h2>Static checking</h2>
<p>
There are four phases to the checking of the input.
<UL>
<LI>Resolving input names.  Each input item is interpreted as a filename, a directory,
a package, a class or a list.  Each input item can be prefaced by one of the option keywords
-file, -dir, -package, -class, or -list to indicate which kind of input it is.  An input
without one of these is interpreted first as a file if a file with that name (or path) exists, as a 
directory if a directory with that name or path exists, then as a package or class.  A file
that is a list must be prefaced by the -list keyword.  Each input is expanded into the
set of jml-relevant files that it contains.
<LI>Parsing a file.  Each file generated by the above is read and parsed.  In doing so
other files in the compilation unit's refinement sequence are also read, but no reference
is made to any of the classes that are referenced in the input file.  The result is a 
composite parsed compilation unit.  Syntax errors will cause this phase to partially
or completely fail.
<LI>Typechecking.  Each class and routine in a compilation unit is then
checked to be sure it is well-formed.  In the process, any type names in
the compilation unit are resolved: their type declarations are found from the
directories specified in the sourcepath and classpath.  Consequently, 
additional files may be parsed and typechecked.  Errors such as missing
type definitions, expressions that have the wrong type or semantic errors
such as misusing a static declaration of a member of a type can cause this phase to fail.
Typechecking currently cannot be performed incrementally, since the
checking of one class is dependent on many others.  Thus if the 
project settings or the set of
input files are changed, all typechecking must be redone.
<LI>Static checking.  In this phase, verification conditions are 
created for each class and routine and sent to the prover subsystem
for checking.  Code that appears to violate
the specifications, according to the prover, results in "warnings" being
issued.  The checking of a given routine may depend on the specifications
of many other classes and routines. 
The static checker can operate on each routine individually,
presuming all relevant classes have typechecked successfully.
</UL>

  <a name="Reviewing">
<h2>Reviewing the results</h2>
There are three tools for reviewing the results of static checking.
<h3>The tree of input elements</h3>
The results pane shows the list of input elements (files, directories, packages, etc.).
Once the input element has been resolved into the list of files contained in it, those
files are shown as the next level of nesting.  If the file is parsed successfully
(including the other files in the refinement sequence),
then the next two levels of nesting will show the classes and the routines
contained in the parent compilation unit.
<p>
The tree of compilation units, classes, and routines is color-coded.  
The background color
for each tree node indicates the errors produced.
<UL>
<LI><B>White</B>: The item has not been processed.
<LI><B>Red</B>: An error or static checker warning occurred in processing.
<LI><B>Green</B>: All checks passed.
<LI><B>Yellow</B>: Some cautions were generated, but no errors or warnings.
<LI><B>Orange</B>: Some child nodes have errors (useful if the tree is collapsed, 
to know about hidden children with errors).
<LI><B>Blue</B>: The static checker timed out or the verification condition was too large.
</UL>
<h3>The error window</h3>
As each routine is checked, if there are warnings or errors or cautions produced,
an output window is generated that contains the text of the corresponding messages.  
This is produced for any of the parsing, typechecking or static checking
phases that have errors.  Thus there is displayable output for any node that is marked
as having not passed its checks.  The output window is scrollable and the output
messages contain the file name and line numbers of the offending statements.  You can
display the output of any node by ALT-clicking on the node label in the results tree or
by selecting the node and then activating the "Error Window" menu item under the "View"
menu.

<P>
An editor window can be launched for a compilation unit, a class, a
routine, or an error message.  This brings up a very rudimentary 
editor, positioned at the appropriate line number.  Minor edits can
be performed and the result saved back to the file system.
Changes that are not saved (or not yet saved) are not used in static
checking; the checker always reads from the file system.  Those saved are
only used after the tool has "Reloaded" the input.  You can bring up
an editor window by either
<UL>
<LI>clicking on a line in the error window that contains a file name and a 
line number (this will scroll the window to the specified line), or
<LI>selecting a file, class, or routine in the results tree and then selecting the 
View->Editor menu item from the menu bar, or
<LI>selecting a file, class, or routine node in the results tree while holding down the
CONTROL key.
</UL>
	   
<a name="Actions">
<h2>Static Checking Actions</h2>

This section is a reference to all the GUI operations (menus, buttons,
accelerator keys,...) that can be performed by the tool.  Details of 
the two option panes are given in succeeding sections.

<h3>Window actions</h3>
<B>Close window</B>: (Clicking the X in the upper right on Windows,
the red button in the upper left on Mac).  This action terminates the
program.  There is no confirmation dialog, even if you have loaded and
altered a project.
<BR>
Question: TBD - should it ask to save the current project?
<P>
<B>Other window operations</B>: Other generic window operations have
the same effect as for other windows on that platform.
<P>
<h3>File menu</h3>
<B>New Project</B>: This action will delete the current project
(but not the project file or any other file associated with the project)
from the tool and initialize to a default, empty project.  There is no
confirmation dialog that you want to forget that current project.
<BR>
Question: TBD - should it ask to save the current project?

<P>
<B>Open Project</B>:  This action will launch a file browser enabling
the user to choose a new project file to load.  There is no
confirmation dialog that you want to forget the current project.  The file
browser begins in the current working directory, but subsequent uses of the
file browser begin in the directory where it was last left.

<P>
<B>Save Project</B>:  This action will save the current project
in the same file from which it was loaded.  If there is no source file
(since the project is a modification of a default project), then this
button will provoke the same action as "SaveAs Project".  There is no
confirmation that you do indeed want to save the new state of the project.

<p>
<B>SaveAs Project</B>:  This action will launch a file browser enabling
the user to choose a directory and file name under which to save the
current project.  There is a confirmation dialog that asks if you want to
overwrite an existing file, should you choose one.  The same file browser is
used as in the "Open Project" browser, and thus repeated uses of SaveAs will
start the file browser in the directory where the previous one ended.
<p>
<B>Close</B> (on non-Mac platforms):  Exits the program without any confirmation 
dialogs.
<P>

<H3>View menu</h3>
<p>
<B>Error window</B>: Launches a window displaying any output text corresponding to any
selected nodes in the results tree.  Silently does nothing if nothing is selected.
<p>
<B>Editor window</B>: Launches an editor window for any files or routines that are selected
in the results tree.  For selected routines, the window will scroll to the region of the
routine declaration.  Silently does nothing if nothing is selected.
<P>
<h3>Check menu</h3>
<p>
<B>Check All</B>:  Begins a full set of checks on all the input.  Items that are already
checked are not re-checked.
<P>
<B>Check Selected</B>:  Begins a full set of checks on each selected node and its children.  Items that are already
checked are not re-checked.
<p>
<B>TypeCheck All</B>:  Performs typechecking but not static-checking on all the input.  Items that are already
typechecked are not re-checked.
<P>
<B>TypeCheck Selected</B>:  Performs typechecking but not static-checking on each selected node and its children.  Items that are already
typechecked are not re-checked.
<p>
<B>Parse All</B>:  Performs parsing but not type- or static-checking on all the input.  Items that are already
parsed are skipped.
<P>
<B>Parse Selected</B>:  Performs parsing but not type- or static-checking on each selected node and its children.  Items that are already
parsed are skipped.
<p>
<B>Resolve All</B>:  Converts all input items into the set of implied files.  Items that are already
resolved are skipped.
<P>
<B>Resolve Selected</B>:  Performs parsing but not type- or static-checking on each selected node and its children.  Items that are already
resolved are skipped.
<p>
<B>Clear All</B>:  Clears away all results of static checking.  This is useful if you want to
rerun static-checking with a different set of options.  It does not reread the input files
or redo any resolving, parsing or typechecking.
<P>
<B>Clear Selected</B>:  Clears away all results of static checking for selected nodes and their children.  This is useful if you want to
rerun static-checking with a different set of options.  It does not reread the input files.

<P>
<h3>Tools menu</h3>
<P>
<B>Gen. Skeleton</B>:  This will eventually provide a means to generate a specification 
skeleton, but is not yet implemented.
<P>
<B>Garbage Collect</B>: Initiates garbage collection.  Note that the status bar shows the
current memory consumed by the application.

<P>
<h3>Help menu</h3>

<p>
<B>Documentation</B>: Brings up a scroll-able window containing this documentation.
<P>
<B>Issues/Bugs</B>: Brgins up a scrollable window containing release notes about the 
application, including known problems and some of the outstanding feature requests.
<P>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<P>
<B>Reload</B>: Clears away the results of all name resolution, parsing, and checking, as well
as the results tree.  It rereads the input list in the light of any classpath or other 
changes to options, regenerating the top-level of the output tree.
<P>
<B>Clear</B>: Deletes the results of any static checking, but not of parsing or typechecking.
If any nodes are selected, only those nodes and their children are cleared
(equivalent to "Clear Selected"); if no nodes are selected, everything is cleared (equivalent
to "Clear All").
<P>
<B>Check</b>: Performs static checking, and any prerequisite name resolution, parsing or
typechecking.
If any nodes are selected, only those nodes and their children are checked
(equivalent to "Check Selected"); if no nodes are selected, everything is checked (equivalent
to "Check All").
<B>Stop</B>: Pressing this button cancels the current operation and any pending operations. 
Some computations, particularly typechecking, may take a bit of time to halt.

<H2>Status area</H2>
The status area is below the button area and above the tabbed pane area.  It consists of 
two labels showing current information and two colored squares giving other status information.
<P>
<B>Current action label</B>:  The label to the left shows the current activity (e.g. parsing,
typechecking...) and the item being acted on.  If the area is blank, no processing is 
happening.
<P>
<B>Memory usage label</B>: The label to the right show the current memory usage as 
reported by calls to the runtime system.  It is updated on a regular schedule.
<P>
<B>GUI action square</B>: The colored square on the left shows the current activity of the
GUI:  Blue - waiting for a command; Green - processing in response to a command; Yellow -
waiting for a response from the prover.
<P>
<B>Prover action square</B>: The colored square on the right shows the current activity of the
prover:  Black - not running; Blue - waiting for a command; Green - proving.
<P>
<h2>Project inputs pane</h2>
This pane (along with the ESC options pane) contains the material which is the input to the
static checker.  Changes to any elements here will cause the results pane to be reloaded.

<h3>Classpath</H3>
<B>Classpath Text Field</B>: Enter here the CLASSPATH which is to be used to find the
classes referenced by the input files.  This is not the CLASSPATH used to run the 
application.  The syntax is that of standard directory paths; use the separator 
character appropriate to your platform.  Wild-card characters and variable references
are not permitted.  The data entered into the field is "accepted" by the application when
a return character is typed or when the field loses focus.  Note that the field does not
necessarily lose focus when one proceeds directly from typing in the field to selecting a
menu item (such as Save).
<P>

<h3>Spec path</h3>
<B>Spec path text field</B>:  Enter here the directory path for system specification files.
You may also include specifications for libraries that you reference by your inputs.  This is
a standard directory path.  The comments about data entry under CLASSPATH above are pertinent
here as well.  The application jar file includes a set of JML specifications for system
classes and JML model files; thus the default Spec Path is the jar file that contains the
application.
<P>

<h3>Input list</h3>
<P>
<B>Input text area</B>: The large text area in the "Project Files" pane
is used for listing the input items on which static checking is to be 
performed.  One can edit this in a fairly freeform manner.  The application
expects the input in the following form.
<UL>
<LI>One input entry per line.
<LI>An input entry consists of an optional type designator and a name.
<LI>The name is a name of a file, a directory, a fully-qualified package name,
a fully qualified class name, or a list file.
<LI>Files, list files, and directories may be written either as absolute paths or
as paths relative to the working directory in which the application was launched.
<LI>Packages and classes are found on the classpath.
<LI>White space that preceeds or trails a file, list file or directory name is ignored,
unless the full path is enclosed in quotes (").
<LI>A list file is an ordinary text file that contains, one per line, file, directory,
package, class or list names (but not optional type designators).
<LI>The application will interpret each name as best it can, but the user may also provide
an optional type designator to tindicate the type of the entry.
<LI>The type designators are <code>-file</code>, <code>-dir</code>, <code>-package</code>,
<code>-class</code>, and <code>-list</code>.  They must appear at the beginning of a line
of text (no preceeding white space) and be separated from the input entry name by white
space.
</UL>

<P>
<h2>Results Pane</h2>
<B>Results tree</B>:  The results pane contains a tree structure that shows the results of
checking the inputs.  Initially this will just show the input elements.  As checking 
proceeds, four levels of the tree will be populated.
<UL>
<LI>The top level shows the input elements themselves, whether or not they are valid.
<LI>The second level shows all the files/compilation units contained in the input element.
An input element that is a file will just contain the one file.  A directory or package or
list will contain many files.  After parsing, these tree nodes represent the compilation unit
obtained from the file or from the full refinement sequence that contains the given file.
<LI>The third level shows the classes contained in a given compilation unit.  Often a
compilation unit will contain just one class, but it may contain more than one.
<LI>The last level shows the routines contained in each class.
</UL>
The second level is not known until the top level has been "resolved"; the inner two levels
are not known until the second level has been "parsed".  By default the tree will expand as
checking proceeds and new nodes are added, though that can be turned off on the GUI options
pane.
<P>
As checking proceeds, the nodes become color-coded.  The colors have these meanings.
<UL>
<LI>White - not yet processed.
<LI>Yellow - Cautions issued while processing.  At the top level this could be because the
input entry cannot be found; at other levels this may indicate minor parsing or typechecking
issues.
<LI>Green - Processed without problems.
<LI>Red - Errors or staic-checker warnings produced during processing.
<LI>Orange - Some child level has errors.  This color is used so that if the tree is 
collapsed, one can tell which higher nodes have hidden children with errors.
<LI>Blue - Static checking aborted because of inadequate time or too large a verification
condition.
</UL>
<P>
Nodes in the tree can be collapsed and expanded as is customary.  Selections can be made
by clicking on individual nodes; selections can be extended in the manner customary for
your platform (e.g. on a Mac, a node is selected by a click, deselected by a command-click,
multiple selections are made with a command-click, and a range is selected with shift-click).
<P>
As checking proceeds, error windows may pop up.  They will do so by default, but this may
be disabled on the GUI options pane.  You can also request a window showing the output for
a given node by ALT-clicking the node (on a Mac this is an ALT or OPTION click; on my 
Linux laptop this is ALT-CONTROL-click).  
You can also obtain an error window by selecting a node (or nodes) and activating the 
View->Error Window menu item.
Currently only one error output window is shown
at a time.
<P>
You can request an editor window for a source file as follows.  You can select a node
(or nodes) and activate the View->Editor Window menu item.  Alternatively you can
CONTROL-click on a node in the tree.  Alternatively, you can click on a line in the error
window that contains a filename and line number.  In each case an editor window for the
appropriate file is launched; in the latter case the window is scrolled to the neighborhood 
of the designated line.  Similarly, if the window is launched by choosing a class or 
routine node, the window will scroll to the region of the declaration of that class or
routine.

<P>
<h2>Error output window</H2>
The error output window is a non-editable text window that shows the output text produced 
when checking a given node of the tree.  It can be launched as described above from the
results tree.  It can be scrolled as is customary.  The one customized behoavior is this:
clicking in a line containing a file name and (optional) line number will result in launching
an editor window for that file and scrolled to the indicated line.  There is just one error
window that will show the text for the most recent request; the title of the window shows
the node to which the text belongs.
<P>
<h2>Editor windows</h2>
An editor window is associated with a single source file.  It is launched as described above
from either the error window or the results tree.  It provides very rudimentary editing 
capability, but suffices for making simple changes to a specification and saving the result
to the file system.
<P>
At the top of the editor window are a few controls:
<UL>
<LI>Save button: Saves the current text to the file system.
<LI>Reload button: Reloads the text from the file in the file system, losing any edits
that were made.
<LI>Go To Line text field:  Entering a line number in this field and typing return will
cause the window to scroll to the neighborhood of that line.
</UL>

<h2>ESC Options</h2>

Not all of the options available on the command-line are available in
the GUI.  Some are not relevant, some have an unknown or untested effect,
and some are too little used (and some we haven't gotten around to).
Unless indicated, the default for each option is off.  Most of them
are binary valued options with simple toggles to turn them on or off.
<p>
<h3>Simplify path</h3>
The Simplify path text field must contain the path to a Simplify executable appropriate
to your platform.  You can either type into the field directly or use the browser button
to open a file system browser to locate the file.
<P>

<h3>Control of input</h3>
<B>source 1.4</B>: When on, Java 1.4 input, 
possibly including assert statements,
is presumed.  If the option is off, the assert identifier is 
interpreted as an ordinary identifier and not a keyword.
<p>
<B>enableassertions</B>: If on (requires source 1.4), then Java assert
statements
are enabled; otherwise they are ignored.
<p>
<!---
<B>jmlAssertions</B>: If on, then Java assertion statements are 
enabled and are treated as JML assertions.  [[[ TBD - fix this one]]]
<p>
<B>preferSource, preferBinary, preferRecent, neverBinary, neverSource</B>:
(Default is preferRecent) These mutually exclusive options determine which of
a .java or a .class file is used.  [[[ TBD - fix this one ]]]
<p>
--->
<B>parsePlus</B>: If on, parses annotations in '//@' and '/*@' comments,
which are normally only processed by the JML checker.
<p>

<h3>Control of output</h3>
<B>noCautions</B>: If on, no Caution messages are output, only warnings and
errors and fatal errors.
<p>
<B>noSemicolonWarnings</B>: If on, suppresses errors caused by missing
terminating semicolons (technically illegal in JML, but tolerated by
ESC/Java2).
<p>
<B>noNotCheckedWarnings</B>: If on, suppresses cautions about JML 
language features that are not checked by the static checker.
<p>
<!---
<B>nocheck</B>: TBD
<p>
<B>typecheck</B>: TBD

<h3>Control of static checking</h3>
<B>loopSafe, loop, loopCount</B>: TBD
<p>
<B>mapsUnrollCount</B>: TBD
<p>
TBD: counterexample, noredundancy, plainwarning

--->
<P>
<h3>Debugging helps</h3>
<!---
<B>verbose</B>: Logs a large quantity of output to show the progress of
the tool's execution.
-->
<B>showErrorLocation</B>: If on, then a stack dump is produced just prior to each
output message, to assist in determing the location in the code reporting
the condition.
<p>
<B>showDesugaredSpecs</B>: If on, outputs a desugared and denested form of
each routine's specifications.
<!----
<p>
<B>pxLog</B>: TBD
---->
<p>
<B>pgc</B>: If on, outputs the guarded commands generated for each routine.
<p>
<B>pdsa</B>: If on, outputs the dsa form generated for each routine.
<p>
<B>ppvc</B>: If on, outputs the verification conditions (as sent to the prover) generated for each routine.
<!----
<p>
<B>testMode</B>: If on, replaces the output of version numbers, time
stamps and other variable elements so that output can be compared
automatically against oracle data files.
<p>
TBD... quiet, bootpath, -v
<p>
TBD - show usage message
<p>
TBD - avoidSpec, depend, processRecursively
---->

<h3>Warning types</h3>
The options in the two columns on the right side of the pane designate the various
types of warnings that the static checker checks.  All except 'DeadLock' are on by 
default.  Turning these off is equivalent to using the '-nowarn' option on the command-line.
The documentation of ESC/Java2 provides information about each kind of warning.
	   
<P>
<B>Disable All button</B>: This turns off all warning types (resulting in no static checking
at all).
<P>
<B>Enable All button</B>: This enables all of the warning types.

<h2>GUI Options</h2>

<B>Auto Expand the nodes</B>: When enabled (which it is by default), then as nodes are 
added to the result tree, they are expanded, showing their children.
<P>
<B>Auto scroll</B>: When enabled (which it is by default), then as processing proceeds,
the result tree pane scrolls to keep the nodes currently being acted upon in view.
<P>
<B>Breadth first checking</B>: When enabled, then processing proceeds by first doing all
input entry resolution, then all parsing, then all typechecking, then all static checking,
processing all designated nodes at each phase.  When disabled (depth first checking), then
each node in turn is processed fully to the degree requested (e.g. each node in turn will be 
fully static-checked, before moving on to other nodes).
<P>
<B>Show error windows automatically</B>:  When enabled (which it is by default), then as
nodes are processed, if there is output text, an output window is automatically produced and
made visible.
<P>
<!----- TBD
<B>Output line wrap</B>: If on, then lines are wrapped in the output (error) windows;
if off, then horizontal scrollbars are used if the lines extend off-screen.
<p>
<B>Editor line wrap</B>: If on, then lines are wrapped in the editor windows;
if off, then horizontal scrollbars are used if the lines extend off-screen.
<p>
<B>Separate output windows</B>: If on, then each routine, class or compilation unit
that generates output will generate its own window.  If off, then one window is shared;
as output is generated for a new check, it replaces what was formerly in the window.
Note that individual separate windows can always be obtained by selecting an item 
with the Control(???) key held down.
