<h2>
Quick Start
</h2>

To build CVC3, do the following in the root directory of the CVC3
distribution:

<pre>
   ./configure
   make
</pre>

If this fails, read the next section for more information.

A successful make creates a library libcvc3 in the lib directory and an
executable cvc3 in the bin directory (these are actually links to
the actual files which are stored in architecture and configuration-dependent
subdirectories).

By default, make creates optimized code, static libraries, and a static
executable.  To build the "debug" version (much slower but more error checking)
use:

<pre>
   ./configure --with-build=debug
</pre>

To build shared libraries (and thus a much smaller executable), use:

<pre>
  ./configure --enable-dynamic
</pre>

Be sure to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to &lt;cvc3dir&gt;/lib when using shared libraries.

Alternatively, these and other options can be changed by editing the
Makefile.local file after running configure.  However, be aware that re-running
configure will overwrite any changes you have made to Makefile.local.

The subdirectory test contains an example program using the library
libcvc3.  To try it out, do the following:

<pre>
   cd test
   make
   bin/test
</pre>

<h2>
Advanced Configuration
</h2>

The configure script checks for the components needed to build CVC3.  If for
some reason, the configure script is missing or doesn't run on your platform,
you can recreate it from configure.ac by running autoconf.

As the configure script runs, if something is not found, it complains.
configure looks for components in standard locations and also uses several
environment variables that you can set to help it find things.  In particular,
you can set CPPFLAGS to -I<I>includeDir</I> if you have headers in a
nonstandard directory and LDFLAGS to -L<I>libDir</I> if you have libraries in a
nonstandard directory.  Run ./configure --help for a list of all such
environment variables.

<h3>
GMP
</h3>

One of the components CVC3 depends on is the GNU Multiple Precision (GMP)
library.  Many Unix-like distributions include gmp packages.

If you do not have GMP installed or your installation does not work, we
recommend that you install it manually:

1. Download the GMP source code from http://swox.com/gmp/

2. Unpack the sources, and from the root-directory of the GMP source code, run

<pre>
   ./configure 
   make
</pre>

   On some Solaris machines, you may need to configure GMP with
  
<pre>
   ./configure ABI=32
</pre>

   to make the resulting GMP library compatible with the CVC3
   libraries.  The reason for this is that the default ABI that gcc
   chooses in CVC3 compilation is not necessarily the default ABI
   that the GMP configure script selects, and one of them may need to be
   adjusted.

3. Now, either install GMP system-wide (make install), or supply the
   appropriate values for CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to the CVC3 configure script.

If for some reason, you do not want to use GMP, you can configure CVC3 to use
native arithmetic by running:

<pre>
   ./configure --with-arith=native
</pre>

If you compile CVC3 with native arithmetic, it is possible that CVC3 may fail
as the result of arithmetic overflow.  If an overflow occurs, you will get
an error message and CVC3 will abort.

<h3>
Platforms
</h3>

CVC3 should run on most Unix-like platforms including Linux, MacOS, and
Cygwin.  Some platform-specific issues are documented here.

<h4>
Mac OS
</h4>

If you want to build shared libraries on Mac OS, you may need to set
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.3 or higher.

<h4>
Cygwin
</h4>

In order to use GMP on Cygwin, make sure the following packages are installed:
gmp, libgmp-devel, and libgmp3.


<h3>
Other Configuration Options
</h3>

Other configuration options include where to install the results of "make
install" (see below), what type of build to use (optimized, debug, gprof, or
gcov), and whether to use static or dynamic libraries.  For help on these
options, type

<pre>
   ./configure --help
</pre>

configure creates the file Makefile.local which stores all of the configuration
information.  If you want to customize your build without rerunning configure,
or if you want to customize it in a way that configure does not allow, you can
do it by editing Makefile.local.  For example, you can build a debug, gprof
version by editing Makefile.local and setting OPTIMIZED to 0 and GPROF to 1 (by
default, gprof runs with an optimized executable).  Note that for most
configuration options, the objects, libraries, and executables are stored in a
configuration-dependent directory, with only symbolic links being stored in the
main bin and lib directories.  This allows you to easily maintain multiple
configurations and multiple platforms using the same source tree.

<h4>
Additional make options:
</h4>

To rebuild dependencies, type:

<pre>
   make depend
</pre>

To remove just the executable or libraries in the current configuration, type:

<pre>
   make spotty
</pre>

To remove in addition all object files and makefile dependencies for the
current configuration, type:

<pre>
   make clean
</pre>

To remove all files that are not part of the distribution (including all
object, library, and executables built for any configuration or platform),
type:

<pre>
   make distclean
</pre>

To build a tarball distribution of the currenct source tree, type:

<pre>
   make dist
</pre>


<h2>
Installing CVC3
</h2>

To install CVC3 system-wide, (assuming you have already run configure) run:

<pre>

   make install

</pre>

Installation depends on two configuration options: prefix and exec_prefix.  By
default, both are set to /usr/local, but these can be overridden by specifying
the correct arguments to configure or by editing Makefile.local.

Installation copies all necessary header files to &lt;prefix&gt;/include/cvc3.  It
installs the library libcvc3 in &lt;exec_prefix&gt;/lib and the executable cvc3 in
&lt;exec_prefix&gt;/bin.  By default, a static library and executable are installed.
If you want to install shared library versions, configure for shared librareis as
described above.

<h2>
Documentation
</h2>

To build HTML documentation, run

<pre>

   make doc

</pre>

Then open doc/html/index.html in your favorite browser.
