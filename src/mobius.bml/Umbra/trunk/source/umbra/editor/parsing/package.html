This package contains all the classes which handle the scanning and parsing
of the different areas in a byte code document.

<!-- Put @see and @since tags down here. -->
<ul>
  <li>{@see BytecodePartitionScanner} creates the partition of the document
    into the main sections: default, BML, header section, and throws
    section.</li>
  <li>{@see BytecodeScanner} handles the colouring of the default areas of the
    document.</li>
  <li>{@see BytecodeBMLSecScanner} handles the colouring of the areas of the
    document that contain BML.</li>
  <li>{@see NonRuleBasedDamagerRepairer} handles the colouring of the areas
    of the document in throws clauses and in header lines.</li>
  <li>{@see BytecodeWhitespaceDetector}, {@see BytecodeWordDetector} and
    {@see SpecialNumberRule} are used in {@see BytecodeScanner} and
    {@see BytecodeBMLSecScanner} to recognise whitespace, words and numbers
    with surrounding marks (e.g. #).</li>
  <li>{@see TokenGetter} is a class which generates tokens to colour the
    byte code document text. This contains only functionality that mediates
    between the tokens and the colouring mode and particular colours.</li>
  <li>{@see ColorManager} is the class which manages the colours that are
    obtained from the operating system and are used in the colouring of
    the text.</li>
  <li>{@see ColorValues} is a container for all the colour and text style values
    arranged in modes.</li>
</ul>
